LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
The Library Management System (LMS) is a project that was created to 
computerize and automate library activities for their efficient management. 
This project replaces the manual handling of library tasks with a 
comprehensive and user-friendly software solution, divided into two main 
modules: ADMIN and USER.
The LMS enables the organization and administration of a library's resources 
that cover materials required by students and staff members. It allows users to 
issue books with distinct limits, on both the number and duration, that are 
based on their roles and they can also be limited in quantity. Each book is 
individually identified by its title, author, and a specific copy identifier, thus 
making sure that the record's accuracy is kept for the user transactions like the 
issuance, return, the overdue dates and the fines for late returns
